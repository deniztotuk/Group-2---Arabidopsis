# Group-2---Arabidopsis

#### Analysis of Polyploidy in Arabidopsis Species

## Overview
This project explores the phenomenon of polyploidy in two Arabidopsis species: *Arabidopsis arenosa* and *Arabidopsis lyrata*. Our research focuses on understanding how independently formed autopolyploids in these species may have exchanged adaptive alleles , potentially influencing their evolutionary trajectories.

### Objectives
- To analyze allele frequency spectra across normal *arenosa* populations, autohexaploid *lyrata* populations, and their hybrids to determine differences and implications for survival and diversity.
- To explore the possibility of hybrids exhibiting greater genetic diversity, comparing them to pure populations and assessing if they resemble pseudo-allopolyploids.

## Installation
This project requires Python and several dependencies, managed via Conda. Below are the instructions to set up the environment:

```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install matplotlib==3.4.3
pip install numpy==1.19.5
# Add additional dependencies as necessary
```
